<p>Study Buddy is a mini project that was inspired by a random conversation with a friend about exam periods and how some students usually need go to the campus nightly to meet with other students in order to read together.</p>

                    <p>Being a mini project, I only designed a few pages to get a feel of what an app like that would be like.
                        The goal was to envision what a platform that enables students achieve their goal (group studying) without stress and safety concerns. However, while ideating, I figured limiting the app&apos;s usage to group studies is a waste of potential. So, I went online to find out other things students would like then included related functionalities. E.g. Class reminders.</p>
                    
                        <p>I also added <strong>streaks</strong> because studying gets overwhelming and having something as little as a fire symbol to cheer you on can be encouraging. It can also be a way to maintain acccountability.</p>

                            <img class="content" src="images/study-buddy-homepage.png" alt="this image is of the study buddy homepage screen. It gives shows the ongoing discussion, some upcoming discussions and a list of past discussions">

                        </figure>

                        <p>Overall, I had so much fun designing this because it was challenging given how it&apos;s unfamiliar territory, we do not have lots of apps out there for comparison. Arranging contents on a larger screen was something I also spent considerable time on but it all came together in the end and I am happy to share this as one of my portfolio projects.</p>
