<h6>Overview</h6>
<p>We designed a digital marketplace that improves the connection between small-time food vendors and their customers. Beyond that, it also provides them with business managing tools.

                       <p>For an innovation that exposes local restaurants to a wider audience and gives people the choice of a more convenient way to get their meals, it is hardly surprising that online meal services quickly became a big sector. 
                        In Nigeria alone, online food delivery service is expected to hit a 13.71% compound annual growth rate and with the exponential growth of this market, logistics soon became an inconvenience to both vendors and their customers. Enter the solution, food delivery applications with Jumia Foods as a pioneer.   </p>                      
                    <p>Due to how easier they made things, especially during the lockdown, food delivery apps quickly rose to fame and other companies have since joined the trend.  However, even a venture as successful as this one isn&apos;t exempted from hitting its own snags. From limited payment options and long ordering processes to poor communication, users have expressed some dissatisfaction where delivery apps are concerned. This is where Nourisha comes in.</p>
                       <p>We believe that convenience should be made accessible and that&apos;s why we set out on a mission to make a product with game changing features that facilitate effeciency and convenience.</p>
                    <section>
                        <h5>Early Stages</h5>
                        <p>We had to conduct two separate interviews at the beginning of our design process because we initially left out a key target group: 
                          food vendors. However, once we began to analyze the data compiled from the first interview, we quickly realized the oversight and scheduled another.</p>
<p>At the end of it all, we pinpointed a number of problems that people seem to have with ordering meals online and food delivery applications:</p>
                      <ol>
                          <li><b>An absence of accurate order tracking:</b> Users reported that the tracking tools available on the food delivery apps they've used never show the exact location of the dispatch rider.</li>
                          <li><b>Problems with location detecting:</b>  Some of our interviewees who live in areas not easily detected on the map expressed frustration at having to resort to dining-in or self pickup.</li>
                          <li><b>Quality assurance:</b> Some interviewees mentioned that the reason they haven't tried ordering food online is because they're trying to avoid the case of <i>'what i ordered vs what i got'</i>. 
                            They referenced the experience of some displeased customers they witnessed personally or on social media.</li>
                      </ol>

                      <p>In order for us to keep these problems at the forefront of our process, we categorised our interviewees and developed three distinct user groups which are represented in personas that tell their stories in a way that helps us better understand their needs.</p>

                      <h5>What We Are Offering</h5>
                      <p>Following extensive deliberation, we concluded on designing an app that not only benefits customers but also food vendors. 
                        We&apos;re offering a product that is highly beneficial to small-scale food vendors yet useful to even the larger and more popular ones. 
                        Over the course of the interview we became more familiar with some problems that are common amongst vendors who are just starting and we decided to not only design a product that helps sell and connect with their customers but one that helps scale their businesses in sales and management too.</p>

                      <p>Armed with what we already know about the market and the needs of users, we began to sketch different design ideas to solve the problems we&apos;ve identified. We came up with some of the screens displayed below</p>

                      <h5>Feedbacks &amp; Iteration</h5>
                     <p>Once we had our high fidelity prototypes ready, we tested it amongst a range of users and recorded their feedback. Reports drawn from this study revealed a need to revise some part of our designs for improved user satisfaction.</p>

                      <p>After all factors have been considered, we decided on final looks for the screens of our design.</p>

                      <p>I also tried my hands at drawing icons for this project. Some of them are shown below</p>

                    <section>
                      <h5>Project Takeaway</h5>
                      <p>This project made us realise the importance of clear presentation. Case in point, how quickly users were able to track the rider's location and direction on the map once we reviewed the design after the usability study.
                        We also learned a lesson on being more inclusive as some users outside of the 18-35  don&apos;t really understand how to use rating stars. We also learned to think one step ahead by providing features users didn&apos;t know they needed.
